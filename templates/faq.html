        <div class="panel-content">
          <p>Buyers can only request for cancellation once for every order. As such, once your request is rejected or withdrawn, you would not be able to submit another cancellation request for the same order.</p>
          <p>Once you have requested for order cancellation, the seller is to respond to your cancellation request within 2 days (48 hours); If the seller fails to respond to the cancellation within that time frame, the order will be automatically cancelled by the system and you will be refunded accordingly:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Credit/Debit Card - 7 to 14 working days</li>
              <li>ShopeePay - 24 hours</li>
              <li>PayNow - 24 hours</li>
            </ul>
          <p>You can cancel your order by: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Tapping on <b>Cancel Order</b> in the Order Details page.</li>
              <li>Choose a cancellation reason.</li>
              <li><b>Confirm </b>to proceed with the cancellation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>For paid local orders [without pre-order]</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Instantly cancel your local order anytime before the seller has arranged for shipment.</li>
              <li>You will not be able to cancel your order once the seller has arranged for shipment.</li>
              <li>Refund will be automatically processed back to your mode of payment once a paid order has been cancelled.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>For paid overseas orders [without pre-order]</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Instantly cancel your overseas order within 1 hour of placing the order unless the seller has arranged for shipment.</li>
              <li>You will need the seller's approval to cancel your order if it has passed the 1 hour mark.</li>
              <li>You will not be able to cancel your order once the seller has arranged for shipment.</li>
              <li>Refund will be automatically processed back to your mode of payment once a paid order has been cancelled.</li>

            <p><b>For paid orders [pre-order]</b></p>
            <ul>

              <li>You will not be able to cancel your order if the seller has arranged for shipment.</li>
              <li>Refund will be automatically processed back to your mode of payment once a paid order has been cancelled.</li>

          <p>The Return/Refund option will not be available for orders that have not passed the Estimated Delivery Date shown on your Order Details page, unless your order has been updated as Delivered.</p>
          <p>Here’s what you can do if you have not received your order.</p>
          <ol>
            <b><li>If your order has not been updated with any tracking status:</li></b>

            <ul>
              <b><li>Order may be in-transit</li></b>
                  <p>International delivery usually takes 9 to 25 days. Kindly wait for the order delivery status to be updated. You can raise a refund request if the order is still not delivered after the Estimated Delivery Date.</p>
              <b><li>>Order handed over to delivery partners</li></b>
                  <p>If your order has been handed over to our logistics partner, you can check the delivery status directly with them. If the order is being delivered using Seller’s Own Fleet or Other Logistics Provider, you can reach out to the seller for delivery updates.</p>
            </ul>
            <b><li>If the delivery status has been updated as Delivered</li></b>

            <ul>
              <b><li>Extend the Shopee Guarantee period</li></b>

                  <p>If the order hasn’t been delivered by then, raise a refund request to prevent your payment from being released to the seller.</p>
                  <p>To raise a refund request:</p>
