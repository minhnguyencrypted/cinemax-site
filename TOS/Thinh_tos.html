    <h2><b>I. INTRODUCTION</b></h2>

Please read the following Terms of Service carefully before using this Site or opening a Shopee account ("Account") so that you are aware of your legal rights and obligations with respect to Shopee Interactive Holding Limited and its affiliates and subsidiaries (individually and collectively, "Shopee", "we", "us" or "our").</li>
        <li> The "Services" we provide or make available include (a) the Site, (b) the services provided by the Site and by the Shopee client software made available through the Site, and (c) all information, linked pages, features, data, text, images, photographs, graphics, music, sounds, video, messages, tags, content, programming, software, application services (including without limitation any mobile application services) or other materials made available through the Site or its related services ("Content"). Any new features added to or augmenting the Services are also subject to these Terms of Service.</li>
        <li> BY USING THE SERVICES OR OPENING AN ACCOUNT, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR IRREVOCABLE ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.

IF YOU ARE YOUNGER THAN 18 YEARS OLD OR THE RELEVANT "AGE OF MAJORITY" WHERE YOU LIVE, YOU MUST GET PERMISSION FROM A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT AND THAT PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN MUST AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE REACHED THE "AGE OF MAJORITY" WHERE YOU LIVE, OR DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS SECTION, PLEASE DO NOT CREATE AN ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU HAVE ASKED YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN FOR HELP. IF YOU ARE THE PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OF A MINOR WHO IS CREATING AN ACCOUNT, YOU MUST ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE ON THE MINOR'S BEHALF AND YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL USE OF THE ACCOUNT OR SERVICES, INCLUDING PURCHASES MADE BY THE MINOR, WHETHER THE MINOR'S ACCOUNT IS NOW OPEN OR CREATED LATER AND WHETHER OR NOT THE MINOR IS SUPERVISED BY YOU DURING SUCH PURCHASE.</li>
        <li> Shopee has the right to revise these Terms of Service at any time without providing notice to its users. Your continued use of the Services, this Site, or your Account, shall be deemed irrevocable acceptance of those revisions.</li>
        <li> Shopee reserves the right to change, modify, suspend or discontinue any portion of this Site or the Services at any time. Shopee may release certain Services or their features in a beta version, which may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work, and we shall not be held liable in such instances. Shopee may also impose limits on certain features or restrict your access to parts of, or the entire, Site or Services in its sole discretion and without notice or liability.</li>
        <li> Shopee reserves the right to refuse to provide you access to the Site or Services or to allow you to open an Account for any reason.</li>
        
    </ol>

    <h2><b>II. PRIVACY</b></h2>

    <ol>

        <li> Your privacy is very important to us at Shopee. To better protect your rights we have provided the Shopee Privacy Policy to explain our privacy practices in detail. Please review the Privacy Policy to understand how Shopee collects and uses the information associated with your Account and/or your use of the Services. By using the Services or agreeing to these Terms of Service, you consent to Shopee's collection, use, disclosure and/or processing of your Content and personal data as described in the Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li> Users in possession of another user's personal data (the "Receiving Party") must (i) comply with all applicable personal data protection laws; (ii) allow the other user (the "Disclosing Party") to remove him/herself from the Receiving Party's database; and (iii) allow the Disclosing Party to review what information have been collected about them by the Receiving Party.</li>
    
    </ol>

    <h2><b>III. LIMITED LICENSE</b></h2>

    <ol>

        <li> Shopee grants you a limited license to access and use the Services subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service for personal use only. This license does not allow you to make any commercial use or any derivative use of the Services (including without limitation any of its individual elements or Content). All proprietary Content, trademarks, service marks, brand names, logos and other intellectual property displayed in the Site are the property of Shopee and where applicable, third party proprietors identified in the Site. No right or licence is granted directly or indirectly to any party accessing the Site to use or reproduce any such proprietary Content, trademarks, service marks, brand names, logos and other intellectual property, and no party accessing the Site shall claim any right, title or interest therein. By using or accessing the Services you agree to comply with the copyright, trademark, service mark, and all other applicable laws that protect the Services, the Site and its Content. You agree not to copy, distribute, republish, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, modify, adapt, rent, sell, or create derivative works of any portion of the Services, the Site or its Content. You also may not, without our prior written consent, mirror or frame any part or whole of the contents of this Site on any other server or as part of any other website. In addition, you agree that you will not use any robot, spider or any other automatic device or manual process to monitor or copy our Content, without our prior written consent (such consent is deemed given for standard search engine technology employed by Internet search websites to direct Internet users to this website).</li>
        <li> You are welcome to link to the Site from your website, provided that your website does not imply any endorsement by or association with Shopee. You acknowledge that Shopee may, in its sole discretion and at any time, discontinue providing any part of the Services without notice.</li>
    
    </ol>

    <h2><b>IV. SOFTWARE</b></h2>
    <p> Unless accompanied by a separate license agreement, any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to the provisions of these Terms of Service. The software is licensed, not sold, and Shopee reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Shopee. Any third-party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from the Services, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such scripts or code, not by Shopee.</p>

    <h2><b>V. ACCOUNTS AND SECURITY</b></h2>

    <ol>
    
        <li> Some functions of our Services require registration for an Account by selecting a unique user identification ("User ID") and password, and by providing certain personal information. If you select a User ID that Shopee, in its sole discretion, finds offensive or inappropriate, Shopee has the right to suspend or terminate your Account. You may be able to use your Account to gain access to other products, websites or services to which we have enabled access or with which we have tied up or collaborated. Shopee has not reviewed, and assumes no responsibility for any third party content, functionality, security, services, privacy policies, or other practices of those products, websites or services. If you do so, the terms of service for those products, websites or services, including their respective privacy policies, if different from these Terms of Service and/or our Privacy Policy, may also apply to your use of those products, websites or services.</li>
        <li> You agree to (a) keep your password confidential and use only your User ID and password when logging in, (b) ensure that you log out from your account at the end of each session on the Site, (c) immediately notify Shopee of any unauthorised use of your User ID and/or password, and (d) ensure that your Account information is accurate and up-to-date. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User ID and Account even if such activities or uses were not committed by you. Shopee will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorised use of your password or your failure to comply with this Section.</li>
        <li> You agree that Shopee may for any reason, in its sole discretion and without notice or liability to you or any third party, immediately terminate your Account and your User ID, and remove or discard from the Site any Content associated with your Account and User ID. Grounds for such termination may include, but are not limited to, (a) extended periods of inactivity, (b) violation of the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service, (c) fraudulent, harassing, defamatory, threatening or abusive behaviour or (d) behaviour that is harmful to other users, third parties, or the business interests of Shopee. Use of an Account for illegal, fraudulent, harassing, defamatory, threatening or abusive purposes may be referred to law enforcement authorities without notice to you. If you file a claim (under any cause of action whatsoever) either against Shopee, or which in any way involves Shopee, then Shopee may terminate your Account.</li>
        <li> If your Account is or remains inactive (which means you have not logged into your Account) for more than 6 months, Shopee has the right to delete or deactivate your Account and all Shells in your Account shall be forfeited.</li>
        <li> You may only use the Services and/or open an Account if your applicable jurisdiction allows you to accept these Terms of Service.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2><b>VI. CHARGES AND PAYMENT</b></h2>

    <ol>
        <li> If there is a charge associated with the purchase of Shells or any portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge in order to receive Shells or to receive access to and/or the benefits of such Services. The price stated for the Shells and Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. We may suspend or cancel your access to the Services if we do not receive full payment from you within the stipulated due date for payment. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your Account and its Content.</li>
        <li> Under our Shell-borrowing plan, you can borrow and use Shells first and pay back what you have borrowed by topping up Shells to your Account within 7 days (or such other period as we may stipulate from time to time). We do not charge interest for borrowed Shells, but failure to pay for borrowed Shells on time will entitle us to suspend or cancel your access to the Services, as stated above. Please note that this Clause 6.2 only applies to our Singapore operations.</li>
        <li> To pay the charges for Shells or for a Service, you will be asked to select a payment method before you complete your purchase or at the time you sign up for that Service. You can access and change your billing account information and payment method at any time. You agree to allow Shopee to use any updated account information regarding your payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to keep your billing account information current at all times. Changes that you make to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we are able to reasonably act on your changes.</li>
        <li> By providing Shopee with a payment method, you:
            <ol>
                <li> represent that you are authorised to use the payment method that you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate;</li>
                <li> authorise Shopee to charge you for the Services using your preferred payment method; and</li>
                <li> authorise Shopee to charge you for any paid feature of the Services that you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms of Service are in force.</li>
            </ol>    
        </li>
        <li> Depending on the nature of the purchase, we may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) after purchase (and by the stipulated due date for payment) for Shells which are loaned to you under our Shell-borrowing plan (Singapore only); or (d) on a recurring basis for a subscription-based Service.</li>
        <li> We may change the price of Shells and/or any Service at any time. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the duration of that term.</li>
        <li> Once purchased, your Shells will be valid indefinitely until your Account is terminated for any reason or if we are no longer able to legally service your Account (for example, if you withdraw your consent for us to use your personal data). If your Account is or remains inactive (which means you have not logged into your Account) for more than 6 months, Shopee has the right to delete or deactivate your Account and all Shells in your Account shall be forfeited.</li>
        <li> Unless otherwise provided by applicable law or by the express terms of a Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. You may cancel any Services at any time, but all pre-payments and all purchased Shells are strictly non-refundable.</li>
    
    </ol>
