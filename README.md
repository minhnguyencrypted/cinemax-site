## Testing the site
To run tests, you should use **Web Server**, our suggestion is **Apache**, with PHP integration, for
our future PHP implementations.
Copy all files and directories of the project to your Web Server's **Document root location**.

With the Web Server running, on your web browser, go to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` to see the site.

For HTML files, you can directly view them using your web browser, however, some PHP integrations won't work and  
may cause errors.
