# The Mall website
The Group no. 25's Mall website.  
The World-biggest Online Mall for shoppers and sellers all around the world.  
Vist our website here: [Foo Mall](https://minhnguyencrypted.github.io/mall-site/) (GitHub page is **disabled**, site no longer accessible)

Just kidding, this is just a university group project.

## What is this?
This originally was group project in RMIT's Web Programming course.   
We were tasked to write a basic shopping mall website, with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS and PHP.
We couldn't come up with any name for it, so we called it "Mall site".

Upon the completion of the course, I decided to learn new languages (Rust and Python) to learn Back-end stuff.

Then I decided to rewrite this project to add some upgrades and improvements, such as Log in system,
integration with DBMS, better front-end looking, etc for practising. Eventually I chose to use Python, with Flask framework for back-end,
MariaDB for database and W3.CSS for some basic front-end improvements (I'm suck @ front-end actually).

## Why am I doing this?
First, I have to admit we wrote a crappy website. The back-end wasn't well written since we had some troubles
while writing it.
The lack of proper data management resulted in more difficulties in implementing data handling. 
Specifically, our data (products, shops, etc.) which add up to over thousands of items were stored in several CSV files.
This made the data processing task even more complicated and prone to errors. 
Code organisation and writing style were really bad, fixing bugs and adding more feature were a big challenge.
Rewriting in a back-end framework and practice a good code convention can improve the codes and packages organisation
and get rid of messy code, results in more ease in maintaining and upgrading.

Second, the front-end sucks. HTML files, as well as CSS files and JS code were poorly written by everyone, including me.
Why? My major excuse is I'm suck @ front-end. TBH, upon the rewriting, I have no ideas about how to improvement the front-end of the website.
So, I decided to use W3.CSS and not touching JS.
