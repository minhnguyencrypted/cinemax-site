      <p>The information displayed on this page depends on the logged-in status of the users. If a user has logged in, this page displays the information of that user (for example, full name, email address, phone number, profile picture, etc.). Otherwise, it displays a log-in box where the user can enter either her email address or phone number, a password, and click on a "Login" button to log in. Besides the log-in box, there are 2 more links: Forgot Password and Register. The Forgot Password and Register links point to 2 different pages (described later). Use the same header and footer as the mall home page.</p>
